## Project Title
The Town Of Wakewood

## Project Brief
This Optimised Developer Tool will be used to present varying OpenGL Techniques. These include, a Geometry Shader, Shadows, Noise, and Particles and Animation. This application will be used to showcase these elements in real time and allow you to understand the different concepts within OpenGL.

### Documentation
#### How does the user interact with your executable? How do you open and control the software you wrote (exe file)?
The Town of Wakewood can be download [here](https://github.com/caleb-long19/COMP3015_Optimised-Developer-Tool/releases/tag/v1.0). Once downloaded, extract and open the folder. Double click "Project_Wakewood.exe" to open the application. The loading time of the application will vary based on your systems hardware. Once the program has loaded, you will be presented with a low-poly town. In the top left corner you will see a graphical user interface (GUI), developed using ImGUI. Use your mouse to interact with the GUI. Left click on the buttons or tick boxes to interact with them. Hold the left mouse button on the sliders and drag left/right to alter their values. Each button/slider has a title above them, indicating what they do. Close the application by clicking the "x", located at the top right of the window, or press the "Exit Application" button on the GUI.

#### How does the program code work? How do the classes and functions fit together and who does what?
The application utilises multiple techinques, these include: Geometry Shading, Shadow Volumes, Cubemaps, & Particles and Animation. 

#### What makes your shader program special and how does it compare to similar things?
The Town of Wakewood has been built to simulate a small, top-down, open world setting of a small town. The visual look of the tool is used to represent games such as Cities: Skylines (Developed by Colossal Order, 2015).

In Cities: Skylines, you design large cities, containing residential, industrial, and business districts. AI is present in the game and move around the city without the input of the player. The car models present in The Town of Wakewood are animated, going back and forth on the road, simulating AI. 

The tools visual apperance mimics that of a residential area in Cities: Skylines.

| Alter Game Speed     | :heavy_check_mark:  | :heavy_check_mark:  |
| Build Cities         | :heavy_check_mark:  | :x:                 |

| Music/SFX            | :heavy_check_mark:  | :heavy_check_mark:  |

To make the tool unique from Cities: Skylines, two features were implemented. The first allows the user to alter the speed of the vehicles/traffic separate from the games speed. The second feature allows the user to change the distance the vehicles travel on the road.
